career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Machine learning engineer with 4 years experience leveraging cutting edge research to 
      automate vegetable harvesting in greenhouse thoughout the UK. Always looking for new
      opportunities to learn, I am particularly interested in computer vision with application
      in the real word. 

education:
    - degree: PhD in  Geophysics - Planetary  Sciences
      university: IPGP (Paris)
      time: 2012 - 2015
      details: |
        Detection of solidified magma chambers in the lunar crust through numerical simulations
        and data exploration
    - degree: Masters Degree in Theoretical Physics
      university: Ecole Normal Supérieur,  Lyon.
      time: 20010 - 2012

experiences:
    - role: Lead Machine Learning Engineer
      time: 2016 - Present
      company: Xihelm, London
      details: |
        I lead the team building the brain of the next greenhouse harvesting robots. 

          - Weekly review of the latest research in robotics / computer vision (2D/3D).
          - Design and implement complex data pipeline to ensure our robots are continously learning from their own experiences. 
          - Design and train neural networks on a wide range of modalities (image/depth/pointcloud)
          to solve a large array of tasks required by a complex greenhouse environment (from instance segmentation in 2D/3D to grasp pose estimation and safety evaluation).
          - Develop and maintain robot performance dashboards which inform weekly planning meeting.  
          - Maintain and continuously improve the software stack (ROS/docker).

    - role: Data Science felllow
      time: 2016 - 2016
      company: Pivigo/Royal Mail, London
      details: |
        Highly competitive workshop helping scientists over five weeks to transition to Data Science through business lectures and a concrete project with a data-driven company.

          - I work in a team of 4, referring directly to the head of the Royal Mail data science team, to providea reliable forecast for each mail type arriving in each delivery office in the U.K.
          - I wrote a pipeline in python to rapidly process the 12000 time series, clean the data, handle outliers and remove the seasonality. Using an ensemble of statistical methods and regression trees trained on data from 2014 and 2015, we were able to decrease the forecast error by 35% over 2016 compared to the model currently in use in the company, ultimately leading to a better allocation of resources over the network
          - Finding were presented and very well received by a cross-section of the company who were convinced to use our model in the future. The presentation was also one of the four selected among 24 to be presented a second time to a special  panel of expert.
    - role: Teaching assistant - undergraduate level
      time: 2012 - 2016
      company: Université Diderot, Paris
      details: |
          - Mathematics - Linear algebra, ODE, PDE, Fourier series, Fourier transform.
          - Physics - Mechanics, Experimental Physics.
          - Programming - Python.
    - role: PhD in Geophysics
      time: 2012 - 2015
      company: Université Diderot, Paris
      details: |
        Detection of solidified magma chambers in the lunar crust through numerical simulations and data exploration.

           - Successfully used machine learning and statistics, in combination with a Python library I have written, to process and interpret gigabytes of data from the lunar surface and deliver a one-year project as part of the NASA's GRAIL mission science team.
          - Produce efficient pipelines, written in python, to process and visualize gigabytes of data resulting from hundreds of numerical simulations of cooling magma flows.
          - Develop excellent communication skills, both in writing by publishing 3 papers in major scientific journals, and speaking, presenting my work in 3 oral awarded presentations in leading international conferences.
